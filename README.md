# Volchek.Dev blog

## What is it?

This is a simple blog I put together so I can write about my programming activities and better contentualize them in my own head. If it happens to help anyone, that's an awesome side effect!

## Can I host it myself?

This type of blog is very easy to self-host. All you really have to do is fork it, edit the content as you please, and throw it up on Vercel. Feel free to do so if you'd like!

## What tech did you use to make this?

I bootstrapped this using [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app), but mostly just for a quick tailwind & ts project. The stack as of now is as follows

- NextJS (framework)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Remark (parsing markdown)
  - Unified
  - remark-parse
  - remark-rehype
  - rehype-parse
  - rehype-raw
  - rehype-sanitize
  - rehype-stringify
- Zod (typechecking JSON)
